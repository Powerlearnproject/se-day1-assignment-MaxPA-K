Examples of Prompt Engineering
Simple Prompt: Asking a model, “What is the capital of France?” This straightforward prompt usually yields a direct and accurate response, such as “Paris.”

Contextual Prompt: “In the context of the French Revolution, what was the role of Paris?” This prompt provides additional context, prompting the model to consider historical significance rather than just providing a factual answer.

Instructional Prompt: “Write a formal letter of recommendation for a software engineer with three years of experience.” This prompt guides the model to produce content in a specific format and style, tailored to a particular use case.

Multi-Part Prompt: “Summarize the key points of the following text and provide an analysis of its main argument.” This type of prompt breaks down the task into two parts: summarization and analysis, helping the model handle complex queries effectively.


QUES: Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANS: Example of a Vague Prompt
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt
Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the healthcare industry, focusing on diagnostic tools and patient management."

Explanation of Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective
Clarity:

Vague Prompt: The term "technology" is broad and unspecific, which can lead to a wide range of interpretations and responses. It lacks direction, making it difficult for the model to understand exactly what aspect of technology is of interest.
Improved Prompt: By specifying "artificial intelligence (AI)" and "the healthcare industry," the prompt clearly defines the scope of the discussion. This reduces ambiguity and directs the model to focus on a specific technology and its application in a particular field.
Specificity:

Vague Prompt: The lack of specificity means that the response could cover any aspect of technology, from general trends to specific gadgets, which may not be relevant to the user's needs.
Improved Prompt: The improved prompt narrows down the topic to "diagnostic tools and patient management," providing clear parameters for the response. This helps the model to target the information more precisely, addressing the user's specific interests.
Conciseness:

Vague Prompt: The prompt is too general, which may result in lengthy and unfocused responses that might include unnecessary information.
Improved Prompt: The improved prompt is concise and to the point, asking for a focused explanation about the impact of AI on specific aspects of healthcare. This helps in getting a more direct and relevant answer.
Overall Effectiveness
Targeted Information: The improved prompt ensures that the response is relevant to the user’s specific query about AI's impact on healthcare, rather than a broad overview of technology.
Efficiency: The specificity in the prompt helps in obtaining a more useful and detailed response without extraneous information, saving time and improving the quality of the interaction.
Relevance: By focusing on particular areas (diagnostic tools and patient management), the improved prompt helps the model provide insights that are directly applicable to the user’s needs, leading to more actionable and relevant information.
